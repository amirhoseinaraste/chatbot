# Relationship Chatbot --v : 0.1

This is a simple relationship-based chatbot built using Python and the `nltk` library. The chatbot can interact with users, respond to greetings, and engage in conversations related to relationships.

## Features

- Responds to basic greetings like "hi", "hello", etc.
- Responds to phrases about relationships and prompts the user for more information.
- Uses regular expressions to match user input.
- Conversational reflections to make interactions more natural.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check if Python is installed by running:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If Python is not installed, you can install it via:

Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install python3
macOS (using Homebrew): brew install python
Windows: Download and install Python from the official website: python.org
Installing Dependencies
You'll need the nltk library to run this chatbot. To install nltk, first install pip if you don't have it yet:

```bash
python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

Once you have pip installed, run the following command to install nltk:

```bash
pip3 install nltk
```
How to Run the Chatbot
Clone the repository or download the chatbot script to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory and run the Python script:
```bash
python3 chatbot.py
```
The chatbot will greet you and start conversing. Type "quit" anytime to exit the conversation.
